Space Battle Game


First is to create the classes and the ships.

Next I must link the start button so that the game starts when clicked, and from there, everything else occurs on the console.

Now I have to make it so that whenever I fight an alien, it subtracts the firepower of my USS Assembly from their hull.

Next, I made functions for each alien that needs to be fought.

I successfully implemented the code that determines when alien is destroyed.
